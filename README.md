# 💫 About Me:
I am an energetic and analytical Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Cybersecurity, with hands-on experience in ethical hacking, digital forensics, Linux system administration, and secure application development. I work extensively with Python, C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have a strong foundation in security concepts, vulnerability assessment, and defensive security practices.<br>

I have completed NPTEL Cloud Computing certification and Red Hat Linux System Administration training (RH124 & RH134), where I designed and implemented multiple shell scripting and automation projects, including disk space alert systems, user session logging, password expiry notifications, and zombie process detection.<br>

My practical experience includes Linux administration, VMware-based virtual labs, Kali Linux penetration testing, and web application security testing using DVWA, SQL Injection labs, and OWASP-aligned methodologies. These projects strengthened my problem-solving, scripting, and real-world security analysis skills.<br>

Currently, I am preparing for CompTIA Security+ while expanding my expertise in cloud security, SOC workflows, incident response, risk management, and network security fundamentals. I have also contributed as a co-author to upcoming Springer publications in the domain of cybersecurity and computational intelligence.<br>

I am eager to apply my technical skills in cybersecurity, cloud security, and system administration roles, where I can contribute to securing infrastructure, analyzing threats, and building resilient systems.<br>
